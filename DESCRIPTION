Description: Public attention is an interesting field of study.
    The internet not only allows to access information in no time on virtually
    any subject but via page access statistics gathered by website authors the
    subject of attention as wellcan be studied. For the omnipresent Wikipedia
    those access statistics are made available via stats.grok.se a server
    providing the information as file dumps as well as as web API.
    This package provides an easy to  use, consistent and traffic
    minimizing approach to make those data accessible within R.
