NEWS wikipediatrend 
==========================================================================



version 2.1.x // 2019-01-10 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Major
  - 'old' data from end 2007 up to late 2015 is available again
    * adding handlers for new API made available by data gathering project comissioned by Hertie School of Governance (Simon Munzert) and supported by Daimler and Benz Foundation
    * adding petermeissner.de as first endpoint for newly available data


* Minor
  - fixing some typos


* CRAN compliance: 
  - moving README.Rmd figures to different path
  
  
* API change:
  - capture API errors and turn them into optional warnings




version 2.0.x // 2017-09-24 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- using pageviews package (and wikipedias own API as data source)



version 1.1.14 // 2017-09-23 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- CRAN compliance


version 1.1.13 // 2017-09-23 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


- the stats.grok.se data source went away leading to numerous errors in the tests - those were turned off



version 1.1.12 // 2016-12-30 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX 

- wp_linked_pages() would fail in case of no links at wikipedia page - now it does not / https://github.com/petermeissner/wikipediatrend/issues/27 



version 1.1.10 // 2016-03-18 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX

- tests, README generation as well as vignette generation would fail due to stats.grok.se serving no data after 2016-01-16
- examples were restricted to data prior to that date to make tests and vignette/README generation run smoothly again


* FEATURE

- wp_trend() results came unordered, results are now ordered according to date, lang, title (making it easy to use something like plot( wp_trend("test", from="2015-01-01", to="2015-01-30")[,c("date", "count")], type="b")
- cut loose unnecessary RCurl dependency 


version 1.1.9 // 2016-02-29 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX

- wp_linked_pages() would sometimes return links that do not link to wikipedia pages but to other projects - that has been fixed. 


version 1.1.8 // 2015-10-11 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* FEATURE

- if provided with bad server response data - could not be parsed - wp_trend() would without giving further information: now it reports whatever data was send back from the server along with the warning


version 1.1.7 // 2015-09-22 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX

- the package's functions would fail combined with rvest versions >= 0.3.0 - that has been fixed


version 1.1.6 // 2015-07-21 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX

- wp_trend() would fail with un-informative error if page or lang input would contain NA - now it fails with more informative error: 'Error: all(!is.na(page)) is not TRUE'

- vignette would fail due to NA as page/lang input of wp_trend() - code has been changed to prevent such 


* CRAN COMPLIANCE

- imports from none 'base' R now are made explicit



version 1.1.5 // 2015-07-01 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX
    - adding checks for empty data returned by server (might cause breaking of wp_trend()) and adding tests for such cases 



version 1.1.4 // 2015-06-10 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX

- modifying vignette to comply with CRAN policies: replaced non ascii character in R code by its \u-escape sequence ( \u00e4 )

- modifying vignette to comply with CRAN policies: making code evaluation for code that uses non-mainstream repository hosted packages optional on machines that do not have those installed



version 1.1.3 // 2015-06-04 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGFIX
    - modifying vignette to comply with CRAN policies (dropping lines installing packages if not present)


version 1.1.2 // 2015-05-23 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- modifying caching to comply with CRAN policies

- changing default folder of cache file from temp (basename(tempdir())) to Rtemp ( tempdir() )


version 1.1.1 // 2015-05-23 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- adding ghrr as additional repo to comply with CRAN policies

- changing default folder of cache file from home (~) to temp (basename(tempdir()))


version 1.1.0 // 2015-05-21 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- feature: caching has been overhauled 

- feature: wp_trend() now tries to guess if page was supplied as title with possible special characters or as (url-encoded) URL part and take care of  further processing

- bug-fix: special character support of the packages was lousy and preventing 
the usage of articles of non-standard languages ( - especially on Windows)
  * introduction of the wp_df class to allow for a print.wp_df that 
    a) shortens long strings on print
    b) does not use format() (format() causes UTF-8 characters to be replaced by "<U+xxxx>" strings (propably only))
  * using a package specific write_utf8_csv() and read_utf8_csv() to be able to store and cache data for articles with special character names     (even under Windows, write.csv() does not allow enforcing a specific encoding)

- bug-fix / backward compatibility: with version 1.0.0 old parameters for 
wp_trend() were causing errors

- bug-fix: wp_cache_reset() would stop with an error if called twice in a row - fixed


version 1.0.0 // 2015-04-01 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- api-change: option userAgent deleted: the default is to send information on 
versions of R, wikipediatrend, curl as well as RCurl

- api-change: option requestFrom deleted: the default is to not send the header

- feature: wp_trend() now by default caches data retrievals in a temporary file

- feature: wp_trend(file="save.csv") now allows to specify a file where 
retrievals are stored (this will always add to the already existing data)

- feature: wp_trend() now allows to specify more than one page and/or language 
at a time. data than will be retrieved for every combination of 
page-language and date 

- feature: caching system is persistant wp_cache_file() will report file used for 
caching; wp_cache_reset() will reset cache; wp_cache_load() will return its 
content as data.frame()

- feature: while wp_trend() now (invisibly) returns only data from the current 
request at hand the new function wp_cache() will retrieve data from cache files 
(by default / if no file name is specified it retrieves data from .wp_trend_cache) 

- api-change: the data returned by wp_trend(), cached in cache-file, retrieved by 
wp_cache() does consist of more variables: date, count, project, title,
rank, month

- feature: testthat tests now check base functionality of the package

- bug-fix: non-existing page views for a month have led to an error, fixed.

- bug-fix: wp_trend() now checks date inputs better for logical inconsistencies 


version 0.2.0 // 2014-11-01 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- first puplication on CRAN
