version 1.1.2 // 2015-05-23 ...

- modifying caching to comply with CRAN policies


version 1.1.1 // 2015-05-23 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- adding ghrr as additional repo to comply with CRAN policies

- changing default folder of cache file from home (~) to temp (basename(tempdir()))


version 1.1.0 // 2015-05-21 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- feature: caching has been overhauled 

- feature: wp_trend() now tries to guess if page was supplied as title with possible special characters or as (url-encoded) URL part and take care of  further processing

- bug-fix: special character support of the packages was lousy and preventing 
the usage of articles of non-standard languages ( - especially on Windows)
  * introduction of the wp_df class to allow for a print.wp_df that 
    a) shortens long strings on print
    b) does not use format() (format() causes UTF-8 characters to be replaced by "<U+xxxx>" strings (propably only))
  * using a package specific write_utf8_csv() and read_utf8_csv() to be able to store and cache data for articles with special character names     (even under Windows, write.csv() does not allow enforcing a specific encoding)

- bug-fix / backward compatibility: with version 1.0.0 old parameters for 
wp_trend() were causing errors

- bug-fix: wp_cache_reset() would stop with an error if called twice in a row - fixed


version 1.0.0 // 2015-04-01 ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- api-change: option userAgent deleted: the default is to send information on 
versions of R, wikipediatrend, curl as well as RCurl

- api-change: option requestFrom deleted: the default is to not send the header

- feature: wp_trend() now by default caches data retrievals in a temporary file

- feature: wp_trend(file="save.csv") now allows to specify a file where 
retrievals are stored (this will always add to the already existing data)

- feature: wp_trend() now allows to specify more than one page and/or language 
at a time. data than will be retrieved for every combination of 
page-language and date 

- feature: caching system is persistant wp_cache_file() will report file used for 
caching; wp_cache_reset() will reset cache; wp_cache_load() will return its 
content as data.frame()

- feature: while wp_trend() now (invisibly) returns only data from the current 
request at hand the new function wp_cache() will retrieve data from cache files 
(by default / if no file name is specified it retrieves data from .wp_trend_cache) 

- api-change: the data returned by wp_trend(), cached in cache-file, retrieved by 
wp_cache() does consist of more variables: date, count, project, title,
rank, month

- feature: testthat tests now check base functionality of the package

- bug-fix: non-existing page views for a month have led to an error, fixed.

- bug-fix: wp_trend() now checks date inputs better for logical inconsistencies 


version 0.2.0 // 2014-11-01 ... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- first puplication on CRAN
